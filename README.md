#Scala Koans

Koans are small lessons on the path to enlightenment. The aim of the Scala Koans project is to provide an easy learning environment in Scala. Your insight will be derived by encountering failing tests and fixing them so that they pass. A testing framework is used to simplify this process and to get you off to a good start with using Scala.
##NOTE
This is the "exercises" version.  The working koans are [here](http://bitbucket.org/dickwall/scala-koans/wiki/Home)
